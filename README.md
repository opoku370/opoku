-	NumPy: Numerical Computations
-	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data Visualizations
-	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development and data Analysis environment
- Model Selection and Training: Supervised and unsupervised algorithms such as Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, and Clustering (K-Means).
- Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix, MAE, and RMSE to ensure robustness and generalizability.


Tableau:

-	Calculated Fields: Creating complex calculated metrics
-	Data Blending and Joins: Merging data from multiple sources and managing relationships using joins and blends
-	Tableau Public Publishing: Publishing and managing dashboards for sharing and collaboration.
-	Interactive Dashboards Development: Building Dynamic Dashboards with filters, parameters and actions for user friendly experiences.

Microsoft Excel:

-	Power Query: Data connection and transformation
-	Power Pivot: Data modelling for large datasets
-	VBA (Visual Basic for Applications): Automating repetitive tasks and creating micros.
-	PivotTables and PivotCharts: Data summarisation and analysis.
-	Solver and Data Analysis ToolPak: Advanced statistical and optimization analysis
-	Excel Add-ins: Tools like ‘Analysis Toolpack‘, and third party integrations for specialized functions.

SQL: 

-	Data Definition Language (DDL):
Creating and managing database schema objects such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP for tables, views, and indexes.
-	Data Manipulation Language (DML):
Querying and modifying data using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with complex filtering, sorting, and aggregation logic.
-	Joins and Subqueries:
INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, and nested subqueries to efficiently combine and compare relational data across multiple tables.
-	Window Functions and CTEs:
Advanced analytical tools like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for enhanced reporting and sequential analysis.
-	Stored Procedures and Functions:
Develop reusable and modular SQL code using stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers to encapsulate business logic.
-	Data Integrity and Constraints:
Primary/foreign key constraints, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints to ensure accurate and consistent data across tables.
-	ETL Processes:
Design and implement Extract, Transform, Load workflows using SQL for data warehousing and business intelligence reporting.
